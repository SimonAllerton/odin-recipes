Welcome to my first actual project on GitHub.

This repo contains a basic HTML website to display what HTML I've learned so far
while working through The Odin Project. I'll be honest though, I have a bit higher
level of understanding of HTML and CSS than what I'll display here. However, this 
Is a great way to show that I have at least some competency in the basics of HTML.


A little reflection of The Odin Project (TOP) so far.

I also wanted to say that I'm really enjoying learning how to code. So far the 
fundamentals section of TOP has been really fun. I would say that all of this 
has been a refresher of current knowledge I've already had. Well, except for
using Git. Git is pretty sweet! Anyways, I'm excited to continue this journey.
