        <h2>Basic Mashed Potatoes that you will LOVE</h2>

        <p>Peeled and quartered potatoes should be perfectly boiled after about 15-20 minutes. If you leave your potatoes whole, 
            it will take a bit longer.</p>
        <p>The best potatoes for mashing depends on your personal preference, as some varieties will give you fluffy results while 
            others will give you creamy results.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>2 pounds baking potatoes, peeled and quartered</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, peeled, or to taste (Optional)</li>
            <li>1 cup milk</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add potatoes and garlic, lower heat to medium, and simmer until 
                potatoes are tender, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>When the potatoes are almost finished, heat milk and butter in a small saucepan over low heat until butter is melted.</li>
            <li>Drain potatoes and return to the pot. Slowly add warm milk mixture, blending it in with a potato masher or electric 
                mixer until potatoes are smooth and creamy. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
