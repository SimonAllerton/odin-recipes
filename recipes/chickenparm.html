        <h2>A tasty recipe you won't be able to resist, Chicken Parm</h2>

        <p>A delicious keto chicken Parmesan. Enjoy a classic Italian dish, and keep your macros in check!</p>

        <p>For people who say they skip the sauce are missing out. 1/8 C of Raos tomato Basil is 3 carbs. 
            So worth every delicious carb and easily fits my own keto journey with staying under 20 carbs a day.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>1 ½ ounces pork rinds, crushed</li>
            <li>1 ounce grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon red pepper flakes (Optional)</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon ghee (clarified butter)</li>
            <li>½ cup jarred tomato sauce (such as Rao's®)</li>
            <li>¼ cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>Set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.</li>
            <li>Slice chicken breast through the middle horizontally from one side to within 1/2 inch of the other side. 
                Open the two sides and spread them out like an open book. Pound chicken flat until about 1/2-inch thick.</li>
            <li>Beat egg and cream together in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Combine crushed pork rinds, Parmesan cheese, salt, garlic powder, red pepper, black pepper, and Italian 
                seasoning in a separate shallow bowl or plate.</li>
            <li>Dip chicken into egg mixture; coat completely. Press chicken into breading; thickly coat both sides.</li>
            <li>Heat a skillet over medium-high heat; add ghee. Place chicken in the pan; cook until no longer pink in the 
                center and the juices run clear, about 3 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the 
                center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Be careful to keep breading in place.</li>
            <li>Transfer chicken to a baking sheet. Cover with tomato sauce; top with mozzarella cheese.</li>
            <li>Broil until cheese is bubbling and barely browned, about 2 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
